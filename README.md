# Keypad Atmega328p 

This is a 3x4 keypad that displays letters on the lcd screen based on which key has been pressed. Built using an atmega328p, a 3x4 keypad, a resistor and LED light. The code runs on C. 

## Getting Started

Basic components required are:

1. Microcontroller (Atmega 328p-pu)
2. 
3.
4. Power source
5. Wires (male to female and male to male wires)
6. A programmer (atml studio)
7. Board (copper board or bread board)
8. Wires

Set up the circuit as shown in the figure below

### Installing

To upload the code to the chip, 

run this code on atml studio and build it by pressing keyboad shortcut f7    
The following code compiles the code to a .hex file where you made a project files
and then open avr dudes and load the hex file and upload to atmega328p
